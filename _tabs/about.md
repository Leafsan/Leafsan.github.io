Hi. I am an indie game developer in Republic of Korea.

I am making a horror game now. For the practice...and publishing the game!

I am studying game design, programming.

You can contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/L222gamedev) or [Gmail](cwk950906@gmail.com).

You can get faster answer by Twitter mention or direct message. I am little lazy at reading mail.

Thanks :P
